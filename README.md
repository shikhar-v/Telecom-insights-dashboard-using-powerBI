AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers. However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. Atliqoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions.
